This file contains the CLI designs for the books project. 
We have four methods, a book searcher, an author searcher, a method to get the books between certain years and a usage/syntax display statment. 

1. Book Searcher: Given a search string S, print a list of books whose titles contain S (case-insensitive). Books may be sorted by title or by publication year.
Usage: This CLI will take in a string name and output a list of potenteial book titles that contain that string. If no text provided, the function will return all titles. Unless flagged, this function will be sorted by the title of the book but if flagged, it will be sorted by publication year. 


Syntax: python3 books.py -t --titles| <search_text> [-n, -y] <sorting_method>

Arguments:

search_text-optional: (The text to be searched for in titles, if none all returned)


sorting_method-optional: If not included will sort by title.
-n: sort by name of book. 
-y: sort by year


2. Author Search: Given a search string S, print a list of authors whose names contain S (case-insensitive). For each such author, print a list of the author's books. Authors should be printed in alphabetical order by surname, breaking ties by using given name (e.g. Ann Brontë comes before Charlotte Brontë).
Usage: This CLI will allow a user to search to see what books a specffic author has written. Given an authors name it will print out that name followed by every book they have written. 

Syntax: python3 books.py -a --authors <search_text>

Arguments:

search_text-optional (The text to be searched for in author names)



3. Books Between: Given a range of years A to B, print a list of books published between years A and B, inclusive. Books should be printed in order of publication year.
Usage: This function will take in two parameters start and finish. This function will return the titles of all books between those two years in sorted order. If no books are in this range nothing will be returned. 

Syntax: python3 books.py -b --between | [-s]<start_year> [-e]<end_year>

Arguments:

-s start_year-optional (If not included will take all books from start year 0)
 (start year)
-e  end_year-optional (If not included will take all books from end year 2021)



4. Usage: If the user requests a usage statement (via a suitable command-line flag) or if the user's command-line syntax is invalid, print a suitable usage statement.
Usage: This function displays the usage and syntax of the other command line interface tools when called. If called directly, it will take in one of the other command line functions as an argument and display that given functions usage statment. The other time it is invoked is when the syntax of one of the functions is wrong in which case, it will automatically print the usage statment

Syntax: python3 books.py -u --usage

Arguments:
